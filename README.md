# ros2 cyclonedds iceoryx shared memory demo

This is a simple talker/listener demo using shared memoery

**Note**: unfortunately the iceoryx container is not on dockerhub or any other registry, so right now the docker-compose builds the underlying container as well, which requires internet connection as well as time.
